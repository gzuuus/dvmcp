# DVMCP Bridge

A bridge implementation that connects Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to Nostr's Data Vending Machine (DVM) ecosystem.

## Features

- Connect and manage multiple MCP servers through a single DVM instance
- Automatic service announcement using NIP-89
- Tool discovery and execution through DVM kind:5910/6910 events
- Job status updates and payment handling via kind:7000 events

## Configuration

When the package is run for the first time, it will detect if the `'config.dvmcp.yml'` file exists, and if not, it will launch a configuration wizard to help you create the configuration file. You can also create your configuration file by copying `config.example.yml` and changing the values of the fields

```bash
cp config.example.yml config.dvmcp.yml
nano config.dvmcp.yml
```
